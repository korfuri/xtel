* Can I use Xtel for commercial purposes?

Xtel is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License which
allows you this kind of use. The main restriction is to distribute the source
code if you decide to sell Xtel.

* When I start Xtel, I get an error message about the fonts loading
what should I do ?

Read the README!

Xtel uses special fonts which are normally installed by the "make install"
command. To make these fonts recognized by X launch :

xset +fp directory_where_the_fonts_are

If you use XFree86, it is better to add this

FontPath    "/usr/share/fonts/X11/xtel/"

in XF86Config and reload the server.

* Can I use Xtel without having TCP/IP?

No, there is no more NO_NETWORK option since 3.3.0 release.

This flag does not exists anymore because LINUX and all other UNIX systems xtel
can run on supports TCP/IP protocol. The loopback interface (named lo on LINUX,
address 127.0.0.1) can support all Xtel communication needs, therefore there is
no requirements on the availibitily of a connection to a local network or to
the Internet.

Moreover, this flag was sometimes misinterpreted by users which sent annoying
emails to the author!

* How do I specify a xteld server name?

The default server name is localhost. This is the appropriate configuration
when the server and the client run on the same computer. There are 
different ways to change the name :
	* When you launch Xtel use the -serveur option
	* In the X Ressources file add this line
	
	xtel*serveur: the_server

* When I start Xtel, I receive "Erreur de connexion au serveur XTEL...", what
should I do?

The specified server is not available using TCP/IP or the xteld daemon is not
correctly installed (read the LISEZMOI concerning the modification of
/etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf). Warning, if you use TCP/IP, the xteld
daemon MUST NEVER BE LAUNCHED MANUALLY (it will be launched by the inetd
superserver)

If Yellow Pages/NIS service is enabled, the xtel service shall be declared in
the corresponding NIS map.

* The modem dos not connect to, what should I do?

See below.

* Which modems are supported by Xtel?

All modems supporting the V.23 protocol could be used with Xtel. Therefore all 
modems which have been agreed by France Telecom should work. Watch out - the 
V.23 mode of some modems (like USR ones) is disabled by default. In that case,
use a correct AT command in xtel.lignes to enable it.

Read carefully the README file which contains information about
detecting/configuring modems.

If your modem does not appear in the list, please DON'T ASK ME the right
configuration to be used. I don't know it.

   * Read the documentation supplied with your modem or ask the vendor about
     the code sequence to switch to V23 mode.
   * Or try to discover the right code sequence with using a terminal emulator.
     Your mileage may vary.

* Could I use TVR with Xtel?

Yes, if you have a modem which supports it ! As far as I know, only some COM1 
and Djinn Flash modems support it.

[Image] Last news: TVR is accessible from I-Minitel, which is supported since
the 3.3.0 release of XTel.

* The modem does not dial, what should I do?

	1. Add a \d (this is a delay) at the beginning of the dialing string in
	xtel.ligne file. It makes the modem synchronize on the xteld speed.

	2. If this does not help, uncomment the line

	#define DEBUG_XTELD

	in the Config.tmpl file. Xteld will then display debugging information on
	/dev/console by default or use syslogd if you have enabled this option.

* Is there an english version of Xtel?

Not yet. The MINITELR is mainly used in France. However, the 3.1 version and
newer should be very easy to translate because all messages are gathered in the
ressources file Xtel-msg (or Xtelm-Msg for the Motif or Lesstif version).

* Is there a Windows version of the Xtel client?

No, but xteld can be used with Hyperterminal Private Edition 3.0 up to 5.0 from
Hilgraeve.

* Can I find any binary distributions of Xtel?

Yes, but for some OSs only. Check out the xtel homepage.

* Where can I get information on Xtel?

In the french linux or x11 newgroups like fr.comp.os.linux.configuration or
fr.comp.apps.x11. If you can't find any answers, you can email me :
pierre@ai.alienor.fr

* Is Xtel I-Minitel compatible?

Yes. Customize the xtel.services configuration file as needed.

* The xtel program installed from .rpm package does not work on my system, what
should I do?

Rebuild the .rpm binary package from its source .src.rpm:

  rpm --rebuild xtel-3.3.0-1.src.rpm

then install it again from /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386.

* How to customize Xtel key shortcuts?

Xtel is using standard translation tables, therefore adding lines like the
following ones in your X11 resource file (.Xdefaults or alike) will be enough:

xtel*ecran_minitel.translations: #override \n\
Tab:       emission-commande(H) \n\
BackSpace: emission-commande(G)

Below is the mapping between Minitel keys and commands:
 ENVOI         A
 RETOUR        B
 REPETITION    C
 GUIDE         D
 ANNULATION    E
 SOMMAIRE      F
 CORRECTION    G
 SUITE         H
 CONNEXION_FIN I
